Patterns, paradigms, algorithms, best practices, optimisation… and an untold list of other ‘things’ you, as a developer, focus on to level up your skillset. 

But becoming a great developer isn’t just about writing great code. It’s also about learning the stuff ‘around the edges’. Those things that, when learned and applied, will take your skillset to an entirely different level. As a Principal Developer, I firmly believe these skills are essential to becoming the best you can be at what you do and are expected of you when applying for more senior roles.

So here are a handful of things you can do - that don’t involve writing code - that will make you a better developer. This is predominately aimed at front-end developers, but any developer should be able to get something from this list.

## Learn your editor inside-out
Anyone who really _knows_ their editor will agree entirely with this: watching another developer using the same editor you use but doesn’t know how to use it effectively is incredibly painful. Seeing them point and click their way around, looking through folder structures trying to find a certain file or doing a basic search and finding hundreds of results… which they then start looking through… is so frustrating.

This is especially so if you’re helping them or pairing with them. You desperately want to take over their keyboard because you know just how much faster and more efficient it would be if you were in control.

So whatever editor you use, learn the shortcuts, get the right add-ons, set up the config so you’re highly productive. Learn how to navigate and use your editor with the keyboard; using the mouse or trackpad will only slow you down and make you less productive. If there’s a dropdown menu item you use regularly that doesn’t have a shortcut, bind one to it yourself.

Outside of writing code this is the single most important thing I really can’t stress enough: learn your editor. Whatever that editor is, learn it inside-out.

## Learn how to use the command line
There’s no much more to the command line than installing packages, starting up your local development server and running a build. So why not learn it and use it?

When you know how to use the command line to search, compare, copy & move folders and files, jump into Vim for a quick file edit, kill processes, automate tasks… you name it, you’ll wonder why you didn’t do it sooner.

Just like learning how to use your editor intimately, you’ll get a similar productivity boost when you learn the true power of the command line.

## Learn Chrome Developer Tools inside-out
This is obviously more focused on front-end developers, but that’s fine. After all, it’s my bag and what I’m employed to do. This is, along with learning your editor of choice intimately, one of the best things you can do to level-up your skillset. 

The first time I showed a former, experienced colleague the Chrome Performance Profiler and the data we could get from it, it literally blew his mind. He was speechless. And it blew my mind that he didn’t know about it. But that’s the point - most developers don’t bother learning this stuff and they’re missing out on a whole world of knowledge.

Firstly, a mindset tweak: think of the browser as a _runtime_. It’s the thing that runs your code and contains the tools you need to see _how_ it runs your code, and as such you can gain an incredible volume of information about what’s going on.

So learn everything you can about Chrome Developer Tools. Don’t settle for the basics; you’re barely scratching the surface if you do.  Learn the keyboard shortcuts, the profiling, the auditing, how to use the coverage tools, the network blocking tools… everything.

Every time a new version of Chrome is released, the DevTools release notes are right there in the console. You can even watch the YouTube video series [What’s New in DevTools](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIBDSojZWBv4QJNoT4GNYzQD) and read the same content per release at (for example) [What’s new in Chrome 83 DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/03/devtools).

You can of course apply this to any browser you like, but please remember the vast majority of front-end developers use Chrome, so if your deep-level knowledge is in (for example) Firefox, you might not be able to help out your colleagues as much as you’d like as there are obviously differences.

## Read/Play with code from other repositories
Use React? Vue? Angular? \<insert whatever library/framework here\>? Do you know how it works? I mean, _really_ works? Spend some time figuring it out, or at least, figuring out how parts of it work.

Choose a project, clone the code from Github and start playing with it. Trace the stack to see what’s happening and when. Find out what’s really happening under the hood.

Granted, this _might_ require you to write the odd line of code here and there to do this to pause execution etc. (unless you’ve figured out how to do this directly in Chrome).

Understanding how these libraries and frameworks work will further your knowledge and understanding. You’ll be amazing how much you can learn from doing this.

Also look at the pull requests that have been merged or are being reviewed on those projects. Read the PR notes and take a look at what has changed. It will help you understand what’s going on and will add a depth to your knowledge and understanding.

## Learn the core Git commands
Drop the Git GUI, learn the raw commands and how to run them from the command line.

There aren’t many commands you need to know, and learning how they work and what they do will give you so much more confidence in handling your interactions with Git.

Using a GUI like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) actually scares me because I don’t know what it’s doing under the hood. Plus, it’s really easy to click on something you didn’t mean to, or do something funky with your trackpad that does something unintended (like accidental drag & drop). Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I just don’t like using a GUI for something I can do quickly and easily from the keyboard.

Doing your Git work from the command line also adds a level of safety to what you’re doing; you actually have to type out the command and press Enter to make it run, not just click somewhere on a GUI.

Create a dummy repo, or clone an existing repo, and start playing with the commands. At the end of it you can throw it away and you’ll be left with a much deeper understanding of what’s going on behind those point-and-click events.

## Conclusion
These are a handful of ways you can become a better developer without actually writing code. **And before you browse away, just ask yourself this:** how much more confident will you feel and how much more of an impression will you make if, at your next interview, you can drop in a few comments related to your non-code-writing skills and how they help your productivity, understanding and personal development? Believe me, as someone who interviews developers on a regular basis, seeing someone who has taken the time to learn their tooling inside-out makes a massive difference.

It shows you have a level of understanding that a lot of developers simply don’t have: that there’s more to being a great developer than writing great code. And as not too many companies will give you free time to learn things like the command line or how to use your editor properly, it shows you’ve taken your own time to learn this stuff. And that impression will stick with the interviewer.

Part 2 is coming soon, with even more ways of becoming a better developer without writing code.
