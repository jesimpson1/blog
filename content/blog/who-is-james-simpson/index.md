My name is James Simpson. I live in [Northampton](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Northampton/@52.2398317,-0.9154173,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487704236e4aa273:0xcdf495d0d9e86209!8m2!3d52.240477!4d-0.902656) in the UK, and I like to make the world a better place through thoughtful software. I’m currently working as the front-end Principal Software Engineer for a large, multi-country European company.

I’ve been writing code since I was 9 years old. My first proper attempt was writing a database in BASIC on a Commodore 64. Not my code, of course; it was from a magazine. I spent hours typing it out, making mistakes, but ultimately it worked: I could add, delete & update groups, and add, delete & update records within those groups. I was hooked!

Fast forward a few years or so, I studied Computer Science at Northampton College. The course taught the fundamentals of software design and development, using Pascal in the first year and COBOL in the second, with an array of other languages around the edges.

At the start of the second year I had to get a part-time job at a wine shop (I’d just turned 18) to be able to complete the course. We lived about 15 miles away from the college and I had to get the bus daily. My parents couldn’t afford to pay the fees, so I worked 18 hours a week (6 on a Sunday, 12 on a Monday, which was my ’study’ day) to ensure I could get to-and-from college and eat while I was there.

As a result of my academic success on the course (awarded Distinction for both years), I was put forward by my form tutor when a local business got in touch with the college asking for possible candidates for a Junior COBOL Programmer position.

I was interviewed and eventually offered the job. I had no desire to go to university, so I didn’t hesitate to accept the offer. And I was at that little company for 9 years.

That job was awesome. I got to travel to various countries in Europe including Germany, Spain, Holland and Sweden. But crucially, I was taught by (in my opinion) some of best software engineers in Europe. It was an education like no other, and an education you couldn’t get at any university.

Those main players (Colin Ricketts, Brian Kemp and Denis O’Leary) were incredible developers. The main man being Colin; he could see what everyone else missed, he could figure out highly complex designs and architectures in his head _and code them up_ faster than an entire team would take to get just the basics figured out. To me, he’s an absolute genius and I will be forever indebted to having him as my teacher and mentor.

All good things come to an end and I left that company in the summer of 2005 by way of redundancy. I’d been studying web development in my own times since the late 90s, so I spent a couple of years as a self-employed web designer and developer. I also got into affiliate marketing and set up various small income streams selling other people’s products through a variety of websites and pay-per-click marketing on Google’s Adwords platform.

I did well, but ultimately couldn’t earn enough money to sustain it. So I took my second-ever full-time job with another small business, writing and maintaining online banking software for building societies. I kept my personal business going as well, as it generated an income passively with only an hour or 2 needed per week to maintain it, which was needed because my new job was effectively a junior web developer position.

That job was ok, but ultimately wasn’t fulfilling and was, at times, incredibly frustrating. Despite that, I stayed there for 7 years and I’m hugely grateful for the opportunity I was given… and I’ll reference this job again a little later for reasons that will become apparent.

I’d been looking for a new job for a while when a local startup got in touch (via a  recruiter). They were looking for a lead front-end developer for their brand new ticketing platform called [Una Tickets](https://www.duo.ventures/una-tickets).

The young founders ([Amar Chauhan and Georgina Hollis](https://www.duo.ventures/home)) set the company up in 2014 and had been working tirelessly to achieve their seed funding. The backend had been in development for a couple months when I interviewed for the role, and ultimately I was offered and accepted the position and started at Una in January 2015.

It’s fair to say that 2015 through early 2016 was the most intense, pressurised and exhilarating months of my career so far (bearing in mind I’d been working for 20 years by this time). Not only did I build the entire front-end for the Una Tickets platform in around 8 months (though there was still TONS to do), we went through an incredibly stressful acquisition which didn’t complete until the end of Q1 2016.

The purchasers were Sky UK Ltd, who wanted to grow their presence in the ticketing industry. I was in charge of the front-end development, and it was great directing the architecture and development of the front-end platform but the politics were a real problem for me, and some of the staff working there were, let’s just say, not my kind of people.

Unfortunately things didn’t work out and, as part of a cost-savings effort from Sky, they closed the project down in early 2017, less than 12 months after acquiring us.

I took 6 months off before starting a new position at another tech firm in Milton Keynes as Senior Front-end Developer. It was a permanent work-from-home position, which only required me to go into the office every few weeks or so.

I enjoyed working there. I was brought in to revolutionise the front-end for one of their main clients: bringing the platform up-to-date, paying off the tech-debt and improving the overall performance of the sites. If you have much experience with this then you’ll know that this is never an easy task, especially when dealing with years of code and decisions made by less experienced developers. Ultimately, again, the politics were getting the better of me. And I missed leading a team of developers.

This brings us back to my time at the company building online banking software. Someone I used to work with there, Caroline, got in touch and said her current employers were looking for a front-end Principal Software Engineer.

On paper the role sounded ideal: set the direction of the front-end architecture and oversee the entire front-end in general. So coding standards, performance, style… basically everything a front-end team produces. It was what I did at Sky, and I loved doing that role.

But I was hesitant because my current job gave me so much flexibility and family time, what with working from home and all. So I turned down the chance to interview, but was then asked again a few months later as the role still hadn’t been fulfilled.

This time I accepted the chance to interview and was offered the position a day later. After some soul-searching and discussing the role with Jyoti (my would-be line manager, who couldn’t interview me at the time) I decided to accept the offer (after initially declining!).

And so here I am. I started that role in January 2019. And I love it :)

What I don’t mention above is the amount of time I spend and have spent learning. There has barely been a day gone by where I’ve not sought to learn something new. Something to improve myself and my knowledge, or something that will help my team.

I can’t stress this enough. Throughout all of my jobs, all of the good times and the bad times, I’ve never, ever stopped studying. My mantra of life is simple:

_“I’m an expert in nothing; I’m a student of everything”_
